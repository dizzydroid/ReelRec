# Test Cases for Movie Recommendation System

This document outlines the test cases designed to verify the functionality of the ReelRec application, focusing primarily on **Black-Box testing techniques** and demonstrating **Data Flow verification** through end-to-end scenarios.

## Black-Box Testing Strategy

Black-box testing was performed by focusing on the application's requirements and functionality without examining the internal code structure. The primary techniques used were:

1.  **Equivalence Partitioning:** Input data was divided into valid and invalid partitions. Test cases were designed to cover representative examples from each partition.
    *   *Examples:* Valid/invalid movie titles, valid/invalid movie IDs (format, uniqueness), valid/invalid user names, valid/invalid user IDs (format, length, uniqueness), valid/invalid genres, valid/invalid watched movie lists (including references to non-existent movies).
2.  **Boundary Value Analysis:** Test cases focused on the boundaries between partitions.
    *   *Examples:* Empty input files (`movies.txt`, `users.txt`), user files with exactly one user, users with empty watchlists, user IDs of exact required length.
3.  **Error Guessing / Scenario Testing:** Based on potential areas of complexity or common errors, specific scenarios were tested.
    *   *Examples:* Handling of file not found errors, handling of unreadable/unwritable files, processing files with mixed valid and invalid entries, scenarios resulting in "No recommendations".

## Data Flow Verification through Scenarios

While dedicated data-flow tests were not created as separate test suites, the end-to-end scenarios documented below implicitly verify critical data flows within the application. By providing specific inputs and checking the final `recommendations.txt` output or error conditions, we ensure that data (like file paths, validation results, error messages, loaded movie/user objects, recommendation lists) is correctly defined, used, and propagated between the main components (`ReelRecApp`, `Validator`, `RecommendationSystem`).

*   *Example Data Flow Tested:* An invalid User ID format in `users.txt` is detected by `Validator`, the error information flows through `ReelRecApp`, is associated with the `User` object, and is correctly reflected in the final `recommendations.txt` output. (See test case corresponding to `AppEndToEndTest.testApp_userFileHasInvalidUserIdFormat`).
*   *Example Data Flow Tested:* A `FileNotFoundException` during file processing is caught, and the corresponding error message is written to the `recommendations.txt` file. (See test cases corresponding to `testApp_movieFileMissing_outputsErrorToRecFile` and `testApp_usersFileMissing_outputsErrorToRecFile`).
